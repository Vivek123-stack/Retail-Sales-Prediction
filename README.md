# Retail-Sales-Prediction

Welcome to my GitHub Repository

->This code is a part of my Artificial Intelligence Final Capstone Project that I completed after Attending Machine Learning and Deep Learning classes at Simplilearn.

->Simplilearn is a Training Company for professionals which offers courses on wide variety of technologies and processes such as Digital Marketing , Data Science, DevOps, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence , and many more. It is based in India , USA and Singapore.

->You can find the dataset in the dataset.rar archive file. 

->The Dataset contains Retail stores and their sales on each particular day, it also has other features such as No. of customers on particular day, and whether a particular day was a holiday or not.

->Weekly Tasks are given from Week 1 to Week 4, aim is to get the best Machine Learning/ Deep Learning model which can predict the sales best. 

->Weekly tasks are mentioned at the beginning of each jupyter notebook.

->Wide range of techniques have been used such as Linear Regression Models, Non-Linear Regression Models, Time Series Models(ARIMA Model & LSTM) and Neural Networks. 

->Exploratory Data Analysis has been used to see how every feature affect sales.

->Feel free to fork this repository and send me a pull request, you can try to get a better model and get better accuracy than me.
